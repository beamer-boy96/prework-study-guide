# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- My motivation in constructing this webpage was to have an easy to use reference to the notes I took throughout my Prework studying.
- It has always been a goal of mine to build a website from the ground up. It may not be the most glamorous webpage ever built, by any means, however, I know that one day I will look back at this webpage and be so amazed in how far I have come in my website development career. This is the first of many websites I plan on building!
- This webpage allows me to refresh my memory on things I may have difficulty remembering during the web development process and have a convenient place to access my notes!
- I learned many new and cool things that I have wanted to know for a long time. I learned a very helpful analogy which is that building a website can be viewed as building a home. You must first have a strong structure if you are going to build a home, this is where HTML comes into play, it adds the structural rigidity to the webpage. Next is the paint and style of the home which makes it unique an beautiful, this is where CSS comes into play. It adds style, color, and makes a webpage visually appealing. What good is a strong and beautiful home if you cannot interact with it? A home would not be much use if you could not open/close the doors, take a shower, cook food, watch tv, etc... This is where JavaScript comes into play. I learned that there are many programming languages to be discovered and learned, but Javascript is the first one I am learning. JavaScript adds interactivity to webpages and allows users to feel connected to the webpage. I learned many useful features such as for loops, arrays, strings, variables, NaN, boolean values, logical operators, and many more. I am just scratching the surface of what is possible with this powerful tool and I look forward to creating increasingly better webpages in the future!
