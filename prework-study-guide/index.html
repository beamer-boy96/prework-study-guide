        <h2>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>**HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.**</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Commonly used element types to add content to pages: -Text elements -Image elements -Header elements -List elements</li>
          <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>Commonly used element types to divide and describe a page: -Meta-related elements -Content division elements -Semantic elements</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance</li>
          <li>Content division elements define a division of section in an HTML document</li>
          <li>Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate on the webpage</li>
          <li>HTML attributes define additional information about an element and are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>SEO (Search engiene optimization) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a webpage</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The "!DOCTYPE" declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is openend</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure of the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience</li>
          <li>The words "element" and "tag" are commonly used intercangeably in the web development world, but is is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>"ul"= unordered list / "ol"= ordered list / "li"= list items</li>
          <li>"img"= contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage and can contain various attributes, the "src" attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>"br"= creates a line of empty space, or a lline break between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>"a"= anchor (creates links to the same webpage or other webpages)</li>
          <li>"href"= attribute that points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called "child" elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a "body" element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children- in this case, the "body" element- is known as the parent element. This "parent/child" language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML</li>

        <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>**CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.**</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>CSS is used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS= when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style sheet must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS= contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS= files are linked using a <link> element placed in the HTML's <head></li>
          <li>div {color: blue; text-align: justify;}</li>
          <li>div=selector, color=property, blue=value, declaration= color:blue, text-align=property, justify=value, text-align: justify=declaration, declaration block= {color: blue; text-align: justify;}</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two imporant components: the CSS property we want to add and the value of the property</li>
          <li>CSS box model= content-padding-border-margin</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. It indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase the padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger. That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element</li>
          <li>The border property is a shorthand syntax in CSS that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around that element it is applied to</li>
          <li>The content property replaces an element with a generated value. Objects inserted using the content property are anonymous replaced elements</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>**JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages - every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static informaton for you to look at - displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. - you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies (HTML & CSS).**</li>
          <li>In coding parlance, a "variable" is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>Example= a container named "shape" which stores a circle. (var shape= "circle";) "Shape"= name of container, or variable & the data it stores is "circle"</li>
          <li>A "string" stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double quotes or single quotes: letcarName1 ="BMW M5"; let carName2= "BMW M8 Competition";</li>
          <li>Console= a test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
          <li>.log= a method which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console</li>
          <li>console.log method outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument. Ex: console.log(topics); the console.log will output the value of "topics" to the web console because we've added it as an argument inside the parentheses</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer exectues code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including: "If" statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code</li>
          <li>Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false</li>
          <li>Truthy= a value that is considered "true" when encountered in boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. That is, all values are truthy except "false","0","-0","0n","","null","undefined", and "NaN"</li>
          <li>Falsy= a value that is considered "false" when encountered in boolean context</li>
          <li>Boolean= a logica data type that can have only the values "true" or "false"</li>
          <li>If statement= executes a statement if a specified condition is "truthy". If the condition is "falsy", another statement in the optional "else" clause ill be executed</li>
          <li>Type coercion= the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers)</li>
          <li>((===) is the strict equality operator and checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a boolean result "true" if the values are equal and "false" if the values are not equal</li>
          <li>Array= a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storijng multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an "index". Using each piece if data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in an array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable patterns of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and oer. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional "if" statement to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times. By using a "for" loop, we can tell the computer to go through each of the indices in an array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left. In order to use the "for" loop, we need the location of the data (index) and the array's length. The array length is important because the "for" loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named "length"</li>
          <li>A "for" loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
          <li>1) Starting point (since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable "x" and give it a value of "0" because the first index of an array is always "0" -- var x=0;</li>
          <li>2) Condition (as long as the number in the variable "x" is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running which will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array, we use the "length" built-in array property on our shapes array to express that conditon -- x < shapes.length;)</li>
          <li>3) X++ (the final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item, since indices follow a predictable patterm, we know the number increases by 1 each time, the code x+++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1, every time the code loops, "x" will increase by 1 -x++)</li>
          <li>"For" loop example: for (var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
            // code block
          }</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. </li>
          <li>JavaScript files are read from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword, give our function a unique name followed by parentheses, and then add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
          <li>It is common practice to indent the for loop code below the function name, within the curly brackets, to add visual structure to your code.</li>
          <li>To comment out code (making it inactive) add /* before the block of code and */ after.</li>
