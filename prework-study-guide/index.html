          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. </li>

          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword, give our function a unique name followed by parentheses, and then add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
          <li>It is common practice to indent the for loop code below the function name, within the curly brackets, to add visual structure to your code.</li>
          <li>To comment out code (making it inactive) add /* before the block of code and */ after.</li>
